1) Annotations are Java features that enables us to embed supplemental information
  into a source file. 
  
2) All annotation automatically extend the "Annotation" interface. 

3) Annotations can be applied to classes, methods, fields, parameters
  and enum constants. 
  Even an annotation can be annotated. 
  
4) A "Marker Annotation" is a special kind of annotation containing no members.
   A "Single Member Annotation" contains only one member.
   A "Type Annotation" enables tools to perform additional checks on code to help prevent errors. It
   must include "ElementType.TYPE_USE" as a target.
   A "Repeating Annotation" is an annotation that can be repeated on the same element and it is annotated
   with the "@Repeatable" annotation.
  
5) Java built-in Annotations (From the "java.lang.annotation" package) are:- 
   @Retention (specifies the Retention policy), 
   @Documented (marker annotation which tells a tool that an annotation is to be documented), 
   @Target (specifies the type of Java elements to which an annotation can be applied), 
   @Inherited (marker annotation which specifies that the annotation used in a class should be inherited 
               by subclasses inheriting from that class, can be used only on another annotation declaration), 
   @Repeatable, 
   @Native (From java.lang), 
   @Override (marker annotation, can be used only on methods), 
   @Deprecated (indicates that a declaration is obsolete and not recommended for use), 
   @SuppressWarnings (specifies that one or more warnings, that might be issued by the compiler, are to be suppressed), 
   @FunctionalInterface (marker annotation designed for use on interfaces),
   @SafeVarargs (marker annotation that can be applied to methods and constructors)
   
6) A Retention Policy determines at what point an annotation is retained and at what point it is discarded. 
   Java defines 3 such policies encapsulated within the java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy enum. 
   Those are "SOURCE", "CLASS" and "RUNTIME".
  
7) Various Annotation Element Types and where they can be applied to:
   ANNOTATION_TYPE -> another annotation
   CONSTRUCTOR -> constructor
   FIELD -> field
   LOCAL_VARIABLE -> local variable
   METHOD -> method
   MODULE -> module
   PACKAGE -> package
   PARAMETER -> parameter
   TYPE -> class, interface or enumeration
   TYPE_PARAMETER -> type parameter
   TYPE_USE -> type use
   
8) Annotations cannot be Generic, that is, they cannot take Type Parameters.

9) Annotation methods cannot specify a "throws" clause.
